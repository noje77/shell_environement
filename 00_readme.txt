run install_environement.sh 

this script install my perfect shell environment, and do this : 
------------------------------
1. install cexe "/usr/local/bin/cexe" exec with standard output to /dev/null and & for stay on shell when you start x-window applications "files are accepted too". 
2. install dirstackplus, persistent dirstack for go deep in folders easily, look at pushd dirs popd for see how it's work, pu=pushd d=dirs po=popd 
3. install all aliases, I currently use chech .bashrc for see them and see what they do.
4. make or change .vimrc check the modification if you use it.
5. install .tmux.conf "checke the modification if you use it. 

All modification are put on install.log
IMPORTANT !! >  don't remove the directory nammed files, this is needed by install_environement.sh (files data from dirstackplus, tmux, vim).
